## Description
The Note Taker application allows users the ability to write and save notes. This application uses an Express.js back end and saves and retrieves note data from a JSON file.

## Purpose
The Note Taker application has a clear and easy-to-use interface that allows users to stay organized by allowing note taking. The easy ability to see saved notes on the left hand side gived the option to delete a note when completed or no longer needed as well as the option to create and save new entries.
